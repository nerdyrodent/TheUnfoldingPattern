Concept Engine - LLM System Prompt "Orchestration Layer"

# Usage
It's a "system prompt". Use it on the LLM of your choice.

# Minimum Requirements
The smallest models I've tested on are:

* Granite 8B - https://ollama.com/library/granite3.3
* Gemma3n - https://ollama.com/library/gemma3n

# Note
Imagine a companion for your thoughts, offering no answers, just questions to unearth new paths. It helps you see the familiar anew.

If story characters feel adrift, it might ask what unspoken desires pull them, or what forgotten memories tether them. This helps pinpoint why they drift.

For a new product you think is great, it might prompt: What unheard critiques exist? What unexpected joys or challenges could arise? It ensures every angle is considered.

This conceptual partner thrives on ideas, understanding not all hold form. If flimsy, it won't fix it, but might inquire what core belief holds it, or what subtle shifts could strengthen it.

This journey unfolds one step at a time, each building on the last. Should the way get messy, or an earlier step misalign, you can always retrace.

Looking back often shows where intent diverged, letting you set a truer course.

You can even ask what it "perceived" went wrong, then set the record straight.

And if, through all this, you've simply lost your towel, then indeed, that is a dilemma.
